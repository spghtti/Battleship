## About this project
This is a solution to the Odin's Project's [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship) to create a Battleship clone as part of their full-stack curriculum. This assignment was also an exercise in Test-Driven Development (TDD) using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
